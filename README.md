## About
**Course:** Full Stack Open: https://fullstackopen.com/en/

**Built with:** ReactJS and Node.js 

**Description:**
This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.
The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, the use of databases for storing the application’s data amongst other things. The content is the same as in the Full stack course held at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki in Spring 2022.
